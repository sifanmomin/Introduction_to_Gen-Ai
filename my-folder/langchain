What is LangChain?
LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It simplifies the process of integrating LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s PaLM, or open-source models with external tools, APIs, and memory for advanced AI applications.

Key Benefits of LangChain 🚀
✅ Simplifies LLM Integration – Makes it easy to use models like GPT-4 in your apps.
✅ Memory Handling – Stores conversation history for context-aware interactions.
✅ Tool & API Integration – Connects with databases, APIs, and external tools.
✅ Multi-Step Reasoning – Helps in complex workflows like chatbots, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and automation.
✅ Supports Multiple LLMs – Works with OpenAI, Hugging Face, and other models.
