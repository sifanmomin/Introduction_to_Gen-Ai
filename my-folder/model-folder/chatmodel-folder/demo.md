# Chat Model Folder

This folder contains various scripts for implementing and testing chat models using different libraries and APIs.

## Files

### demogroq.py
- **Description**: This script demonstrates the usage of the `langchain_groq` library to initialize and invoke a chat-based model.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Initializes `ChatGroq` with specific parameters.
  - Invokes the model with a sample prompt and prints the result.

### gemmichatmodel.py
- **Description**: This script implements a chat model using the `GEMMI` library.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Initializes the model with specific configurations.
  - Processes input prompts and generates responses.

### hugginfacelocal.py
- **Description**: This script demonstrates how to use Hugging Face models locally for generating chat responses.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Loads a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
  - Processes input prompts and generates responses locally without requiring an API.

### huggingapi.py
- **Description**: This script demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face API for generating chat responses.
- **Key Functions**:
  - Makes API calls to Hugging Face's endpoint.
  - Processes input prompts and generates responses using the remote API.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the scripts. Follow the documentation within each script for specific instructions on how to use them.

## Dependencies

- `langchain_groq`
- `GEMMI`
- `transformers` (Hugging Face library)
- `dotenv`
- `os`

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running:
```bash
pip install langchain_groq GEMMI transformers python-dotenv
