#LLM (Large Language Model)
An LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models use deep learning, particularly transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT, LLaMA), to process and generate text.

Key Features of LLMs:
Understand and generate text in natural language.
Trained on billions of words from books, articles, and code.
Used in chatbots, translation, summarization, and more.
Examples: GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA, PaLM.
